  <p>Hi there!</p>

  <p>I'm a final year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at TU Munich. My research interests include wearable technology, biomechanics, soft robotics, and the applications of controls and machine learning in biomedical engineering.</p>

  <p>During my Bachelor's, I researched trajectory optimisation strategies for a robotic manipulator, with a particular focus on orientation interpolation. Here, I contributed to a project that developed a new orientation interpolation algorithm and a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10161346">paper</a> was presented at ICRA2023 in London, UK.</p>

  <p>In 2023, I visited the <a href="https://www.biomechatronicslab.co.uk/">Biomechatronics Lab</a> (Prof. Ravi Vaidyanathan) at Imperial College London to research control strategies for a lower-limb rehabilitative exoskeleton. A paper has been accepted at ICRA2024 and will be presented in Yokohama, Japan.</p>

  <p>Currently, I am a visiting student at the <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/hbl/">Healthcare Biorobotics Lab</a> (Prof. Liang He) at the University of Oxford as part of my Master's thesis research. The research involves fabricating a wearable soft sensor using 3D printing-based ink writing techniques, taking inspiration from recent advances in soft sensing for soft robotics.</p>

  <p>Feel free to contact me if you want to chat about research or anything in general! I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and possible collaborations.</p>
